## Updated sample style guide with variable fonts and responsive typogrpahy

The purpose of this demo is to show how, when a browser supports variable fonts, you can become much more responsive to the user's device size. This will scale the typography along size, line-height, weight, and optical size axes to give a more appropriate reading experience on a wider range of devices.

I have endeavored to keep the original design and typography intact, but have scoped all of the new typography within an `@supports` block so that the new typography will only be rendered by browsers that will understand what to do with variable fonts.
